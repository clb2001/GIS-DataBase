    "<p>The purpose of the Bell-Lapadula model is to maintain data confidentiality and controlled access to classified information. In the formal model, the entities in a information system are divided into subjects and objects. These subjects could correspond to DB users or different applications that interface with a database, and objects represent tuples/tables in the DB. A data system satsifying the Bell-Lapadula model focuses on the idea of a \"secure state\", where a certain set of security rules is proved to be true at all times. </p>\n",
    "<p>A major facet of the Bell-Lapadula model is the presence of \"security classifications\". These classifications correspond to a heirarchical ranking of how \"secure\" a particular object is. For example, we will use the labels Top Secret, Secret, Confidential and Unclassified. Each object in our system gets one of these labels. Our goal is to make sure information does not get to those who are not cleared for it. To do so, each user also gets a current and maximal security level that dictates which levels of information they can read/write. </p>\n",
    "<p>In a Bell-Lapadula information system, only actions that maintain the following three principles can hold. We will use the notation $L_{m}(s)$ to represent a user $s$'s maximal levels, and $L(O)$ to represent the security level of object $O$. </p>\n",

    "    <li>Discretionary-Security Property: Discretionary Access Control (i.e. the object's owner choosing whether or not specific other users can view their object) is allowed by an access matrix.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<p>The current security level is most importantly used when writing - while a user cannot \"write down\", this is with respect to their current security level, which is equal to or lower than their maximal security level. A user at a high security level can write down, but they must change their security level first. </p>\n",
